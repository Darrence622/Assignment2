# Assignment 2

My assignment revolves around giving user's a city's weather condition right then and there, it will help user to identify the different weathers in different cities.
 
## Design Process

My design is extremely simple with just a black background and white fonts, my website is for users to identify the different weather conditions and temperature of locations that are far away from them. 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to know about the temperature and how it feels like for curiosity.


## Features
1. Shows a dropdown city menu
2. Weather Conditions
3. Current Temperature
4. What temperature it feels like
5. Map
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows user to pick a city from the options and choose, this minimizes mistake and will help the website run more smoothly
- Feature 2 - Shows weather conditions, a main one and a brief description one. This helps users to understand better about the current weather at the location they picked
- Feature 3 - Shows temperature located at the location
- Feature 4 - Shows how the temperature would feel like
- Feature 5 - Shows a map which will be used for future implementations

### Features Left to Implement
- Feature 6 - This feature would direct the user to the location that he/she picked in the dropdown menu in the map in the body of the website

## Technologies Used

    - The project uses **CSS** to design the pages and the background


## Testing
I have not done the media query, hence it will be distorted on mobile.

Requests will not be sent back if there are more than average 3-4 requests at a time.
